/**
 * The four things design contract §8 requires of a dialog, in one place, for
 * the whole app.
 *
 *  1. Escape closes.
 *  2. Focus moves INTO the dialog on open.
 *  3. Tab and Shift+Tab cycle inside it.
 *  4. Focus returns to whatever opened it — a modal that dumps the caret at the
 *     top of the document has moved the reader, which is worse than never
 *     having moved focus at all.
 *
 * This exists because an audit found the floor implemented THREE times —
 * `oi-spurts/useDialog`, `open-interest/useOiDialog`, and an inline effect in
 * TimeSwitch — and, predictably, absent from every overlay whose author did not
 * happen to import one of them. The PCR and Straddle "Series" menus and the
 * Open Interest As-of and Custom-window panels all declared `role="dialog"`
 * with none of the four: on those, Tab walked out of a declared modal, and
 * Escape did nothing because the page's only key handler was bound to a
 * different menu. The failure mode is always the same shape — somebody writes
 * `role="dialog"` without importing anything — so the fix is one import that is
 * obvious to reach for.
 *
 * Two details here are load-bearing and were learned the hard way, so do not
 * "simplify" them back:
 *
 * - The focusable query is NOT filtered by `offsetParent`. That property is
 *   null for every descendant of a `position: fixed` layer in some engines and
 *   for everything in jsdom, so filtering on it yields a trap that silently
 *   finds nothing focusable — a trap that does not trap, and one no test can
 *   catch.
 * - Focus is restored only if it is still inside the dialog (or nowhere). If
 *   the reader has already clicked something else, yanking them back is the
 *   same defect this hook exists to prevent.
