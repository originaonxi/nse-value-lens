 * added together, so a position rolled from this month to the next cancels
 * out: read from the near month alone, every expiry week shows falling open
 * interest everywhere (25 Sep, four days before the September expiry: no
 * Long or short build-up at all, near-month OI down 35–49 %). Price up with OI
 * up is a long build-up; down with OI up, a short build-up; up with OI down,
 * short covering; down
 * with OI down, long unwinding. The span is the Contracts view's window:
 * 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h (read off the future's 1-minute candles, within the same
 * tolerances), or the day, against the previous session's close.
